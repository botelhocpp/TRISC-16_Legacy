# TRISC-16 Processor

## An 16-bit RISC processor made for the "Digital Systems" course using VHDL-2008.

A microcontroller encapsulation was made for the TRISC-16 CPU, including a 64 KB ROM and RAM memories, as well as peripherals and 16 I/O pins.

## Revisions

The TRISC architecture is currenctly in the TRISCv2 revision.

- TRISCv1: 14 simple instructions, including: Movimentation, load, store, logical and arithmetical.
- TRISCv2: 14 instructions added, including: Branch, Comparing, Shift, Rotate, Input, Output and Stack. GPIO and Counter peripherals added, as well as 16 I/O pins.
